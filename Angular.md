<p><strong>What is Angular?</strong></p>
<p>AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly. AngularJS’s data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write. And it all happens within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any server technology.</p>
<p><strong>Why Angular?</strong></p>
<p>Angular is the next big deal. Being the successor of the overwhelmingly successful Angular.js framework it’s bound to shape the future of frontend development in a similar way. The powerful features and capabilities of Angular allow you to create complex, customizable, modern, responsive and user friendly web applications.</p>

<p><strong>Angular version Difference:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Angular Js?</strong><br>
AngularJS was created by Misko Heavery. He had built a framework to handle the downfalls of HTML and also taking ideas and best practices of the libraries which were never done earlier.</p>
<p>This first version of the framework known as AngularJS was launched in the year 2009. It laid the foundation of the present-day front-end application development. Angular JS was one of the best single-page application development solution. Gradually, it wide adoption and become very popular.</p>
<p>Features of Angular JS</p>
<ul>
<li>A JavaScript MVW Framework</li>
<li>Extends HTML support by adding tags, attributes, and expressions</li>
<li>Allows easy event Handling</li>
<li>Supports for Data Binding</li>
<li>Built-In Template Engine and Routing</li>
<li>Form Validations and Animations</li>
<li>Dependencies Injection</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2.Angular 2</strong><br>
After, releasing Angular JS, Angular team released Angular 2 which is complete rewrite of its original Andujar 1 or AngularJS. Angular 2 version is built around the concept of the component. It was rewritten from scratch by the Angular team using Typescript. It offers better performance to web developers. There are many new features along with other improvements and tweaks.</p>
<p><strong>Some Important Features of Angular 2 are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Modern, faster, and highly scalable framework</li>
<li>Equally useful framework for web, mobile, and desktop apps</li>
<li>Web components based architecture</li>
<li>Supports Hierarchical Dependency Injection</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3.Why not Angular 3?</strong></p>
<p>Angular 2 has been a single repository. Each package downloadable with the @angular/package-name convention. For example @angular/HTTP, @angular/router</p>
<p>All package names were assigned version 2, but router package by mistaken was given version 3. Therefore, the development team skipped Angular Version 3 and directly named it version 4 to maintain compatibility with Angular Router’s version.</p>
<p><strong>4.Angular 4</strong><br>
Angular 4 is unlike Angular 2 (which is completed rewritten version of Angular 1). There are in fact only few minor changes and new features added in it. Angular 4 supports TypeScript, which compiles to JavaScript and displays the same in the browser.</p>
<p><strong>Some other features of Angular 4 are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the size of the generated bundled code up to 60%</li>
<li>Animation moved out to a separated package @angular/animations</li>
<li>Supports for if/else statement</li>
<li>Supports for email validator</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5.Angular 5</strong></p>
<p>Angular 5 doesn’t bring any significant change from Angular 4. However, lots of new features and many new improvements are done in this version.</p>
<p><strong>Features of Angular 5:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make AOT the default</li>
<li>Easier to build progressive web apps</li>
<li>Type checking in templates</li>
<li>Support for Internationalized Number, Date, and Currency Pipes</li>
<li>An update to Httpclient</li>
<li>Zone speed improvements</li>
<li>New Router Lifecycle Events</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6.Angular 6</strong></p>
<p>Angular 6 was released on May 4th, 2018. That is 6 months after its predecessor’s (Angular 5) release. The highlights of Angular 6 include the  Angular Command Line Interface (CLI), The Component Development KIT (CDK) and the Angular Material packageupdate. The cherry on top, all three are shipped as part of Angular 6, not separate updates.</p>
<p><strong>Features of Angular 6</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Angular Material Design Library</li>
<li>Angular Elements</li>
<li>Component Dev Kit (CDK)</li>
<li>Command Line Interface (CLI)</li>
<li>An Improved Service Worker</li>
<li>Web Pack Updated</li>
<li>Tree Shakable Services</li>
<li>Multiple Validators For Your Forms</li>
</ul>
